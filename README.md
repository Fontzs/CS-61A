### Overview

`summer 2022`    üçîüñäÔ∏è

[CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su22/) 

‚Äã	CS 61A concentrates on **the idea of abstraction**, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. **It covers functional programming, data abstraction, and object-oriented programming.** 

‚Äã	**Scheme** programming language  (a way to explore functional programming) , and **Regular Expressions** and **the SQL programming language** (a way to explore declarative programming) are all included .
